//This File will keep track of all Expenses we had & will make for this Project.
//The Format for Typing your Expenses is as following: 

[Person's Name], [Amount], [Purpose]

E.g. If Dattaraj makes any payment towards the Project, Just add it as follows:
Dattaraj, Rs.XXX, For Hex Keypad

//Please maintain this format as I can just copy paste it into text file and name it Expense.csv So use comma (,) to seperate name from Amount and Purpose
//So that I open it in Libre Office Calc or Microsoft Office Excel
